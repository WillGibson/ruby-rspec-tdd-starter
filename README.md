# Test Driven Development Code Retreat Ruby + RSpec Starter

## Requirements

* IDE + "working together" plugin to be decided
* Ruby 3.x

## Installation

    bundle install

## Running the tests

You can run the tests via the command line...

    bundle exec rspec

...but it will be a better developer experience if you run them in your IDE where you can use the debugger etc.
